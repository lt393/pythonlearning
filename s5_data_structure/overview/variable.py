Python is dynamically typed. You do not need to declare variables!Â 
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.
Variables can change type, simply by assigning them a new value of a different type.
Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.
You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables.
